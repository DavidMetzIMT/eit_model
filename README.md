### 1.1 Dependencies


### 1.2 Features
 - [x] Serial communication with `Sciospec EIT32-device`
 - [x] Setting/reading measurements setups of the `Sciospec EIT32-device`
 - [x] Impedance Measurements aquisition (continious mode) with `Sciospec EIT32-device`
 - [x] Saving of measurements
 - [x] Replay of saved measurements
 - [x] Liveview plots of measurements values
 - [x] Liveview plots of 2D reconstruction using `pyEIT` reconstruction algorithms:Gauss-Newton solver (JAC), Back-projection (BP), 2D GREIT
 - [x] Liveview plots of 2D reconstruction using Neuronal Network
 - [ ] Liveview plots of 3D reconstruction 
 - [x] Liveview of chamber from usb camera and saving of image for measuremnets 
 - [ ] Complete electrode model (CEM) support (not in `pyEIT` implemented yet)
	
## 2. Installation

`eit_app` is purely python based, it can be installed and run without any difficulty. NOT TESTED YET!!!

### 2.1 Install global

NOT TESTED YET!!!

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install


### 2.2 Install 

## 3. Run the app



**Note:** the following images may be outdated due to that the parameters of a EIT algorithm may be changed in different versions of `pyEIT`. And it is there in the code, so just run the demo.

### 3.1 examples of apps


### 3.2 (3D) forward and inverse computing
